Version 1.3 beta 1
[ January 2016 ]
- Continuing to ruin everything you love about this game.

Version 1.2 beta
[ March 2015 ]
- Changed tons of stuff and none of it is final yet. Hope this helps!

Version 1.1
--------
[14 December 2006]
-Additions
 * Added an announcer voice for game events.
 * Added an overview of the map to the HUD, with sprites for your teammates, and a command to display the whole overview.
 * Added a command vote system allowing players to vote for a server command such as changing the level.
 * Added support for alternative game modes (Speed Capture, Midair, Last Company Standing, Fast Research)
 * Added Tutorial Demos about basics, movements and weapons.
 * Added S&I icon for Steam's game list.

-Weapon and device changes
 * Rocket Pistol: 5 ammo per clip instead of 4, rockets are not affected by gravity, explosion radius reduced, self damage reduced when not carrying a scientist.
 * EMP Cannon: cannister launch doesn't require a charge, cannister detonates on impact and now also deactivates radios, the EMP infection now disables Cloaking and the Super Jump implant too.
 * Crossbow: unzoomed shot is now an explosive hitscan dart, the zoomed shot is the same, self explosive damage reduced when not carrying a scientist.
 * The Tommygun can now only be researched by the AFD company, and the Akimbo snUZIs by MCL, both weapons have been changed to deal a same amount of damage.
 * Cloaking Device: can now make you completely invisible instead of very slightly visible.
 * Mindray: now also heals your company's scientists.
 * Reduced Satchel limit default value from 5 to 3 per player.
 * Reduced Tripmine limit default value from 5 to 2 per player.
 * Reduced radio carry numbers from 3/5/7 to 3/4/5.
 * Disabled explosives from dealing headshot damage.
 * Increased explosive damage push for players standing up.
 * Changed friendly fire off behaviour: firing at teammates doesn't hurt them but still pushes them.

-Movement changes
 * Added new movement techniques: crouch sliding and super jumps off walls. The "Advanced Guide" featured in the Manual explains them, as well as the "Movements" tutorial demo available in the game.

-Research changes
 * Reduced weapon stealing research bonus from a 42 second bonus to a 15 second bonus.
 * Removed the cash bonus given for stealing a weapon.
 * Reduced the refresh rate of experimental weapons.
 * Removed the research bonus given for researching a technology already completed by the other company.
 * Removed the si_constantresearchspeed server variable: research speed is always constant.
 * Reduced Tommygun and Akimbo UZIs research time from 2:15 to 2:00.

-Fixes
 * Updated the si_urban map to avoid the computer becoming unbreakable bug (contribution by Parasite).
 * Fixed the delivery_zone entity crashing the server if it didn't have the "no salvage" flag set.
 * Fixed rockets (and other projectiles and effects) exploding in the sky instead of disappearing.
 * Fixed the arm color from the weapon model being blue when spectating AFD players in first person view.
 * Fixed a bug where a same map could be played twice in a row if a changelevel/nextlevel command had been used before.
 * Fixed a bug where radio music kept on after the radio was destroyed.
 * Fixed mp_timelimit 0 setting the timelimit to 0 instead of infinite.
 * Removed a few notices.
 * Fixed scientist bulb displayed in an incorrect angle in first-person spectator mode.
 * The correct weapon crosshair in first-person spectator view is now displayed instead of a generic crosshair.
 * Removed cloak screen fading in first-person spectator view.
 * Removed view punch when receiving negative damage (eg: barrel on si_movealong).
 * Fixed bug where dying while using the cloak disabled the black screen fade out.
 * Fixed server crash when a tech breakable was the target of another entity.
 * Fixed si_clanmatch score keeping feature.

Version 0.96
--------
[1 July 2000]
-Totally rebuilt code base, integrating Valve's new netcode.
-New tech tree featuring non-weapon researchable upgrades, more voting options and logical research prerequisites.
	The new researchable upgrades are:
	-Manufacturing Process - replaces killed scientists quicker and cheaper
	-Production Speed - weapons and ammo respawns quicker
	-Cloning Method - reduces the player respawning delay time
	-Health/Armour Charger - chargers work much faster
	-Coffee Strength - your scientists work harder, and when an enemy drops a captured scientist, it will
	return to your labs faster
	-Scientist Healing - pressing the Use key on your scientists will make them heal you; this upgrade makes 	them heal you more, and more often.
	-Regenerative Biotechnology - players will regenerate health
	-Cybernetic Leg Implants - increased player move speed
-New weapon - briefcase. Used as a melee weapon and to steal scientists. C4 briefcase bomb is a researchable upgrade option to this; pressing secondary fire arms and disarms the suicide bomb, primary fire detonates it when armed.
-Added new maps: si_metropolis, si_alley, si_colony, si_military, si_moon, si_mill
-Updated maps si_tundra, si_laser, si_hirise
-Added new secondary objective in some maps. si_tundra and si_mill contain Computer Labs, which have valuable research equipment. Destroying the computers in the enemy's Computer Lab will cost the enemy money to replace and will be detrimental to their research.
-Added new technology salvaging feature. On picking up an enemy weapon which your team has not researched, you have the option to return to the Administrator in Human Resources with it. Walk through the Gman with the stolen weapon selected and your team will receive a research bonus.
-Tweaked weapons:
	-Egon removed
	-New Mindray secondary fire - a headshot on an enemy scientist will overload the neural connections in their brain, killing them
	-Contact grenades limited to 4 max ammo
	-Crossbow power upped slightly
-Added scientist-killing penalties. Killing enemy scientists still results in a reduction in your own scientist's efficiency, but now if you continue to kill them, you will be docked frags, and eventually your scientists will place an implant in your brain to zap you if you continue with your homicidal tendencies.
-Added new llama-filters
