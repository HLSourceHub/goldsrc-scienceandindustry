          The methods that your company has been using since its founding are not always the best. In fact, some of them are downright inefficient. It may be a wise move to take time away from standard research and upgrade your facilities. This will be a great incentive for potentially new members of your research team. Replacing your scientists will require less capital, and it will most likely take less time to find the right replacement. Expect this upgrade to increase your rate of capital gain.
