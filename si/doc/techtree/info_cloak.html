          This device coats its operator in a light magnetic field that works to shift the phase of light waves striking it. The result is interference that renders the operator partially invisible. With these devices your employees can walk around the opponents facilities unseen - allowing them to disrupt research without being noticed. However, extended use of it will cause the device to overheat and become quite harmful to the health of the operator. Also, the device cannot align the field very well, and moving too much can cause it to be less effective. It works best when moving slowly, and only for short periods. A secondary mode allows you to move freely while remaining unseen, unfortunately this will drain the battery extremely quickly.
