          Loss of employed security officers is a considerable drain on the capital of your company. Each death results in the time-consuming, costly procedure of cloning them to put them back in action. Upgrading the methods used to clone your employees is an option, and will reduce the time and cost of this operation. Also, upgraded cloning technology can at last handle the highly complex DNA structure of your skilled scientists, dropping the cost of replacing them considerably (although it is still more costly than replacing a security guard due to the complexity of the scientist’s neural structure).
