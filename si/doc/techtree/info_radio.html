          This is simply a standard AM radio with a one-use adhesive on the back. The device is produced by your team to be used as a distraction to your competitors. When placed (the best place for this being in your opponents research lab), the radio will blast preset disruptive music in the immediate area until destroyed (the stations were voted upon by your research team for maximum annoyance). If hidden well, the radio transistor can disrupt the work of your competitors for a very long time.
