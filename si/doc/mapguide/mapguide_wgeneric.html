<p>As your company researches new weapons and devices, they have to be distributed to the employees. Items that have been in production long can be distributed in bulk through these <i>weapon_generic</i>s. In these the employees get a full load of ammunition and all the weapons with the exception of the newest weapons and devices which are distributed through <a href="mapguide_wexperimental.html"><i>weapon_experimental</i>s</a>. Distribute enough of these such that players won't have to fight over tech.</p>

<p>Put only as many <i>weapon_generic</i>s in the Prototype Storage of a base as is necessary. Too many will start to give a performance hit to the players trying to collect. Since only one <i>weapon_generic</i> should be enough to a player as much as they need, try to aim for as few as possible.</p>
<p>Good flow for weapon pickup is essential. Lay out the <i>weapon_generic</i>s such that a player can easily grab one running by. It's not necessary to place many in a line, since a player should only need one, but you may want to put them in groups in case many players need to access them at once.</p>
<p>Make sure your <i>weapon_generic</i>s match the theme of your respawn. Choose the right model such that players are convinced their in a Prototype Storage room.</p>
