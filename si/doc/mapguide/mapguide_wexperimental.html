<p>When a new weapon or device is researched, it is not yet possible for your company to produce it in large quantities. Instead they can only slowly ration out these prototypes to their employees until production kicks in. These prototypes spawn as <i>weapon_experimental</i>s.</p>

<p>Be sure to include one of each of the priorities of <i>weapon_experimental</i>s, otherwise the players will not be able to access all the weapons and devices they have researched. You may decide to have a couple tertiary priority experimentals available, but be sure to only have one primary experimental, as that these should be in the smallest supply. In general, one of each should be the right amount.</p>
<p>Make sure that your <i>weapon_experimental</i>s are in a place such that they catch the eye. It should be immediately apparant to a new player that this is where the new weapons are. Make it look like they are fresh off the press and waiting for eager employees to use.</p>
