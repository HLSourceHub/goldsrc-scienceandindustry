<p>In order to scientists to efficiently navigate the laboratories of a Science & Industry labs, they require node entities. In general, the same guidelines should be followed as per standard <i>info_node</i>s, but the S&I variety has some added parameters to add to the lab ambience if used well.</p>

By default he will just idle at the node. At certain hot spots, add more detailed activities to increase the lab ambience.<br><br></p>

<p>Add your nodes with both navigation and activity in mind. You'll want lots of nodes with interesting activities at your hub areas of the lab, and enough idle nodes connecting these hubs so the scientists can move from station to station.</p>
<p>"Ponder" is the probably the best activity to set in the <i>info_nodes</i>, and remember that <i>info_node</i>s can be set at angles that determine which way monsters will be looking when they perform that activity.  So if you have mainframes, whiteboards, etc. that you would like scientists to walk up to and inspect, remember to place an info_node next to it and at the correct orientation. A "Ponder" activity performed while facing a painting from across the room can have a lot more effect than an idle scientist facing the wall.</p>
<p>Placing <i>info_nodes</i> is tricky business, and compiling with "entities only" will save a lot of time in the trial and error process.</p>
