            Science and Industry is a teamplay modification for Half-Life which places players in the role of
            security officers at one of two competing high tech research corporations. Each of the corporations
            begins with three scientists, who produce research that goes toward better equipment for your company
            and translates directly into an increase in cash flow. The effectiveness of your scientists depends
            on how much time they get to work... so your job is obviously to protect them from enemy raids, and
            raid the enemy to slow <em> their</em> production. Even better, you can capture enemy scientists,
            bringing them back to your lab to establish an overwhelming competitive advantage! All you have to do
            is run to the enemy labs and hit one of their scientists over the head with your briefcase... the
            trick is getting back to your human resources department alive with your new "recruit"...
          </p>
          <p>
            The twist is that each corporation begins with very low technology... so your team must choose which
            technologies to research to gain market share! Upgrading your weapons tech may make you more
            effective in battle, but you'll have a hard time escaping with a scientist if you have no armor or
            bionic implants. Some technologies affect your scientist productivity too... letting you gain a key
            cash advantage in a close game! All this can be yours... just sign on today as a security guard for

            base to find these places. If you are not sure what base you are in, look around for color clues:

                your most recent developments, as well as containers with ammunition and other weaponry. In most
                facilities, this room is merged with the Cloning Facilities to help employees stock up easily fresh

            officer, your mission, above all else, is to keep your corporation's labs <b>secure</b>. When all is
            going well, the scientists should be moving about in the labs, doing a lot of research you don't
            understand. Depending on the layout of the map the labs may be one large room or several smaller
            rooms. Your scientists will be moving about freely in the entire lab area. If you keep your
            scientists happy by keeping the noise level down, they will produce more cash for your team.<br clear="all">
          </p>
          <p>
            Your corporation's scientists will find it VERY hard to work if there is a lot of noise in the labs,
            so part of your job as a security officer is to keep your labs quiet. You keep the labs quiet by
            keeping weapons from being fired in the area. Nothing disrupts work more than a rocket going off near
            your experiments, and this applies to your weapons as well as the weapons of rival security officers.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you fail at this, and noise does happen in your labs, you will notice the efficiency of your scientists dropping. You
            can tell how efficient your scientists are by looking at the atom on the bottom right part of the
            HUD. If all is going well, the atom will be completely white, if your scientists are disrupted,
            the atom will only be partially white, the rest grey. The more grey the atom is, the less
            efficient your scientists are. If your scientists are less efficient, they will produce less cash.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your scientists can be killed by your opponents (they cannot, however, be killed by your team -
            attacking them will only disturb them and hurt their efficiency). You might think this is a good way
            to hurt the rival corporation, as they have to spend money to hire new scientists and their research
            is disrupted for a while. However, your own scientists don't particularly like to hear about their
            colleagues, even at rival companies, getting killed, and so their efficiency will drop each time you
            kill an opposing corporation's scientist. So, in general, killing your opponents scientists is a bad
            idea. However, if you don't have any scientists left on your research team it's open season on your oppoenent.

            At the start of each map, each team will have a set small amount of cash, 3 scientists, and a few
            basic weapons (briefcase and colt defender). A few seconds in, each team's scientists will be ready
            to begin research, a voting session will open: hit your "vote" key and a voting menu will pop up
            with the first choices. Each member of the
            team will have a few seconds to place their votes, then the votes will be tallied and the next
            research objective will be set.

            Each new technology
            that you wish to research requires that you already have researched the prerequisites to that
            technology before research can begin. Each time that your scientists are ready to begin a new area of
            research, a voting session will open. Vote options are separated in 5 basic categories: weapons, implants,
            armor, devices and process upgrades. In each category technologies that you can vote for are displayed in white,
            while technologies that you don't have the prerequisites for yet, or that you have already researched, are displayed in grey.
            Remember that your team begins the round with no armor, and you will
            not get anything from armor rechargers until you research armor technologies.<br clear="all">
          </p>
          <p>
            The speed at which each objective is discovered depends on how many scientists the team has, and how
            quiet they have managed to keep the research labs. If one team recruits the other team's scientists,
            it is quite possible that they will be several tech levels ahead of the opposition.

            If you should happen to die in the line of duty, your corporation will graciously bring you back by
            using cloning technology. The technology does cost money (see chart below). A corporation whose
            security officers spend a lot of their time dying won't have much money left at all. There is also a
            short delay before respawning while the cloning process is completed, which can be reduced by special
            research options. After being cloned, you will be invulnerable for a couple of seconds, use this time
            to dispose of any enemies camping outside your cloning chambers.

            A great way to help the productivity of your labs is to "recruit" scientists from a rival
            corporation. You can do this by sneaking/breaking into the rival corporation's lab, taking out your
            briefcase, and whacking a scientist upside the head. Unfortunately for you, the scientists will
            recognize your uniform as that of a rival company, and will panic and try to run away from you.
            Usually, it's not too hard to catch them (as long the there aren't any rival security officers about),
            and you can sling them over your shoulder and bring them back to the clutches of your company's Human
            Resources department.

            <img src="images/admin.jpg" align="left" alt="The Adminstrator">Once you get a scientist, you need
            to proceed back to your corporation and find the administrator. The administrator (pictured to the
            left) will "convince" the scientist that he or she would be better employed by your company, and your
            team will have one more researcher. If you're having trouble finding the administrator, try following
            the "Human Resources" signs which are helpfully placed in most levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are killed while carrying a scientist, it will be dropped where you died, and will return to
            the enemy labs as soon as it regains consciousness. Until it does, however, your team has the chance
            to pick it up from where you dropped it and bring it back to your base anyway. Only the team that was
            trying to steal a dropped scientist can pick it up, the other team just has to guard it until it
            returns to their labs.<br clear="all">

            If you happen to kill an opponent who is holding technology that your corporation has not yet
            researched, you can grab that weapon or device and take it back to your administrator for a research
            bonus. In order to have him take the weapon out have it ready when you walk up to him. Each
            sucessfully delivered item decreases the amount of time it would normally take to research that item;
            this effect is cumulative. However, in order to finally access this stolen technology, you still need
            to tell your scientists to finish off the research on the salvaged tech by voting for that item.

          <p>
            If your company is ahead on weapons research, or has a device that your oppenent does not have, be
            wary. If you go into a battle weilding that weapon or device and are killed, your opponent will most
            likely jump on that opportunity to destroy your advantage over them by stealing your technology. So,
            if you are heavily wounded, be careful not to drop your valuable technology in a fight.

            In order to know what's important, read up on the map's specs in it's readme. It will display before
            you are selecting your team at the beginning of a game. Read through all the critical objectives for
            that map, and you should know what equipment to seek out and destroy.<br clear="all">
          </p>
          <p>
            The best way to destroy enemy equipment is with a bludgeoning weapon (your briefcase) or explosives.
            Once the equipment is destroyed, that company will start pumping time and resources into repairing
            it, and after a designated amount of time it will be replaced.

            Some maps contain special resources that can give your company a leg up on the competition. Read the
            map's readme before the team selection menu and you should know what resource objectives exist for that
            map.
          </p>
          <p>
            All resources are different, and will be described in detail in the readme. In general, however,
            they follow a pattern where you pick them up from some point (the enemy's base, or some neutral
            ground), and you return them back to your administrator in Human Resources. In many ways, this is is
            similar to delivering a scientist, but the resource can differ in many ways. For one, if you die
            while carrying a scientist, a teammate has a chance of getting the scientist before he/she wakes up.
            With resources, if you drop the resource, it's lost. Also, some resources have time limits to
            delivery time and other properties. Read the map's readme to be sure you know what you're getting
            into when you go for a resource.

            Science and Industry uses separate stats to evaluate the performance of players and the performance
            of a team. Team score is measured by the amount of cash a team has, whereas how well a player is
            doing is measured by numbers of frags. Bonus frags are given for a number of situations, to help
            balance out defense and offence. The current team scores are always shown in the upper-right corner
            of your screen.

            Anyone who has an "E" before their name is their corporations Employee of the Month. They
            have proved themselves to be an experienced and skilled player. Listen to their words, as they are good
            employees to lead your offensive and defensive maneuvers. A good Employee of the Month helps lead his
            team in a firm research direction and formulates a plan for how to protect the scientists (or get
            some back). The undirected team is fresh pickings for their competitor.

            <b>Llamas</b><br>
            If a player has a "L" before their name, beware. In order to achieve this label, they have already
            been revelling in lots of "llama" behavior, which is not helpful to either your team or your
            opponent. Nobody likes a llama. However, if the player "reforms" themselves after time, be nice to
            them; they have seen the error of their ways.

          <b>Scientist Recruiters</b><br>

          <p>
            Employees on your team who are currently carrying an enemy scientist are highlighted on the
            scoreboard in white. Find them and aid them in escorting the scientist back to your company's
            administrator. Also understand that they are most likely unable to communicate with you very well
            during this time, as that they will have their hands full warding off their persuit.
          </p>
          <b>Resource Carriers</b><br>

          <p>
            If one of your fellow employees is carrying a resource back to base his name will be highlighted in
            brown. The exact item he is carrying varies from map to map, as does the actual goal and method of
            collecting the resource. Be sure to read up on a maps resources (if it has any) in the map's info
            screen. But as with scientist carriers, it's generally best to find this person and protect them.

            Now that you are familiar with the basics of Science and Industry gameplay, here are some general
            tips:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Be very careful to the number of scientists your company currently has. If you have less than 3,
                you should focus on attacking the enemy corporation to capture them back. However if you have 4 or
                more you should focus on defending to keep your advantage!
              <li>
                The most overlooked part of S&amp;I by new players is the requirement for a strong defense to
                protect your corporation's scientists and research labs. Remember that it is much easier to protect
                the scientists you have than it is to steal them back from an enemy team with a strong defense.
                Also, defenders get the benefit of the defensive frag bonuses and are closer to their resupply
                areas. Working as an organized team with everyone in a defined role can keep holes from opening up
                in your defenses, as well as giving you a better chance to capture scientists with mass attacks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Vote for technologies wisely... new weapons are fun, but often having more armor or leg implants
                can be a greater advantage. Nearly all of the higher level technologies require the <em>
                Manufacturing Process Upgrade</em>, making it very useful. Many technologies have subtle effects
                that make them very useful, like the efficiency boost from <em>Upgraded Coffee Strength</em> or the
                fact that the <em>Regeneratvie Biotechnology</em> leads to all of the implant and biotech research
                topics. Listen to the more experienced players, they're better informed about what will be of the
                most benefit to your team. Check out the <a href="techtree.html" taret="_blank">Technology Tree</a>
                if you want to become one of these enlightened souls.

                Don't be a llama. Be nice, help newbies, play fair, balance teams, and above all have FUN!
