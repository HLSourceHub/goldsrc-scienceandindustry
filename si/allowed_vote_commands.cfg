// Players are able to vote to trigger a command or change a setting on the server,
// they do so by using "callvote <command> [parameter]", then players use "yes"
// or "no" to vote. The in-game commandmenu features these commands.
//
// Put the commands and settings that the players are allowed to vote for here.
//
// If you want to allow players to vote and change a setting, but still
// want the settings back to default on map change, add each of the voteable setting
// to your server.cfg file with the wanted default value.
//
// Vote server variables:
// - si_voting_allowed: set it to 0 if you don't want the players to be allowed to vote
// - si_voting_time: sets how long a vote can last, default value is 20 seconds
// - si_voting_success_ratio: for a vote to succeed, the ratio of the number of players
//   who voted yes to the number of players on the server must be superior to its value,
//   default value is 0.5, meaning that more than 50% of the players must vote yes for
//   a vote to succeed.
// - si_voting_file: sets which file to look into for the list of voteable commands
// - si_voting_usemapvotelist: sets which file to look into for the list of voteable
//   maps, set to 0 to allow voting for any map

kick                     // "kick [name]" kicks a player from the server
changelevel              // "changelevel [mapname]" changes the map
nextlevel                // "nextlevel [mapname]" sets the map to load once the current map is done

// if your server is passworded, consider adding these:

// startmatch               // restarts the game
// mode                     // "mode [gamemode]" executes the "gamemode/[gamemode].cfg" file
                            // if you enable this, you might want to add a default mode in your server.cfg:
                            // "exec gamemodes/[your_default_mode].cfg"
