====================================================

The recent discovery and unearthing of an ancient, arcane study has
caught the attention of many people at Midland Carbide Labs and 
Amalgamated Fluorodynamics.  The knowledge-hungry scientists, aware of
the vast libraries that might be in the temple, managed to convince
their respective administrators to allocate funds for small, temporary
research facilities near the archaelogical site.

----Objectives----------------------------------------------------------

RECRUITMENT - There are 6 scientists in this map. Kidnap an enemy
scientist by hitting them with the briefcase. Take them back to the
administrator, and he/she will start working for your company instead.
(5 points)

RESOURCES - Recover the tomes of ancient wisdom found in
the basement of the study and return them to your administrator.  The
tomes grant you a 2-minute research boost, and if the drop-off is made
at the beginning of a new research cycle, it will be completed almost
instantly. (2 points)

SABOTAGE - Each of the four bookcases in the labs can be broken,
causing the loss of half of the accumulated research on the
current project.  (1 point each)
