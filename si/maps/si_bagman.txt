Summary = "This is an urban map, both company's are set along side a storage area. You can capture the scientist and break the computers. Allthough its a small map, there are three ways to get in, via the main door, via the windows or via the roof. You can get up in the air via the pipes in the corners of the middle area. The sky is verry high, so you cant touch it even with the gaus."
