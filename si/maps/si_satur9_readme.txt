To install unzip into your /Half-life/si directory with paths turned on.
This map includes a custom materials.txt . You may wish to back-up the
original prior to unzipping, however, nothing was removed form it, only added.

=============================
This is a beta version
PLEASE post on the forums/e-mail me with comments
I want to make this map better for a final release
Your help is much appreciated

This map is now mostly complete, with detail to the labs and hallways and other
minor aesthetical improvements still in production.
