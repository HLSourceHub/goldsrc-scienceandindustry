scientist by hitting them with the briefcase. Take them back to the

enemy lab, both research and cash production are affected when
destroyed. (3 points)

SABOTAGE - The main computer in the extra room of the lab can be
destroyed, denting the enemy funds and causing minor research loss.

----Tips----------------------------------------------------------------

 - You need about 30 seconds to destroy the power supply if you have
   muscle fiber replacements, 1 whole minute if you don't have them,
   so it's not an easy task.
 - The roof gutter you can see in the power supply area is climbable,
   so you don't need the tau to get on roof.
