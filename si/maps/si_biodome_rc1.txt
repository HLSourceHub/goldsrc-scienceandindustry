----Objectives----------------------------------------------------------

RECRUITMENT - There are 6 scientists in this map. Kidnap an enemy
scientist by hitting them with the briefcase. Take them back to the
administrator, and he/she will start working for your company instead.
(5 points)

Retrieval: There are two rare lifeforms hidden in the biodome, 
one for AFD and one for MCL. Retrieve your resource to gain points, 
cash, and research time. 

----Backstory-----------------------------------------------------------

This Biodome was constructed by the parent company of AFD and MCL 
before it was split into the two respective companies. Ever since the 
split there has been arguing over who should control this biodome. 
Finally, the companies have decided to evict eachother out of the 
biodome--with force. However, during the melee a rare lifeform has been 
misplaced and now must retrieved. Rumour has it that it is located 
near water, find it for an insurmountable reward.
